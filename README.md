## Statement of Purpose
BrightU 2.0 is a mobile VR application which helps the salesmen learn about _sticky products_ in an interactive fashion by showing them relevant information in new ways.

## Description
For the duration of my internship, my team and I were tasked with identifying a problem-solution with respect to the **Small-Medium/Enterprise Sales** section of Bright House Networks. Through internal interview sessions with managers we discovered that a large problem lay within the sales team itself. In terms of selling _sticky products_, our salesmen oftentimes did not have the in-depth knowledge on how to properly capitalize on the _"sticky"_ nature of the products. After much research and industry analysis, we agreed that implementing a Virtual Reality learning environment would be the best solution to maximize the comprehension of seemingly complex information. 


## Usage
The application begins by placing the user in a **staging area**, allowing them to get comforable with their HMD before they are made available to the rest of the enviroment. Looking down towards the _Bright House_ logo will initialize the experience. Once in the environemnt, staring at each product produces an animation along with relevant information. The screenshot below depicts what the user will see when interacting with the environment.

**Due to time constraints the only working product is Cloud Solutions**
